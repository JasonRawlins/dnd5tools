<h4>Welcome to D&D 5 Tools alpha!</h4>
<p>
    Creating a character for D&D 5 can be confusing because there are so many options to choose from. Multiple class archetypes, various class features, different feats, and hundreds of spells can lead to decision anxiety as you try to find the best option. 
</p>
<p>
    I often look up guides when I'm making character. Take these two Bard guides:
    <ul>
        <li><a href="http://community.wizards.com/forum/player-help/threads/4146291" class="underline">Wizard's community Bard guide.</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://www.enworld.org/forum/showthread.php?363601-Bardic-Lore-A-Basic-College-of-Lore-Bard-Guide" class="underline">En World Bard Guide</a></li>
    </ul>

    They are each a good resource but suffer from a couple problems. First, they are written from the viewpoint of a single person. Second, they contradict each other. Is Vicious Mockery "The best Bard cantrip in the game and probably one of the best cantrips full stop" or is it "pitiful damage" that "loses its effect at higher levels"? You'd have a hard time deciding without more information (or direct experience with the spell).

    Enter D&D 5 Tools. This site aims to be a resource that lets the community review and rate various options so others can benefit from the collective wisdom of lots of gamers. For the alpha, I've limited it to spells. However, in future versions I'd like to add reviews for skills, class features, feats, backgrounds, etc.
