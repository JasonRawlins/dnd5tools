=======================================
Style Spells so that it looks like a tab
If a logged out user clicks on an vote arrow or the "write a review" button, prompt them to login
Is there a way to load spells more quickly?
Style all content. Possibly leverage Bootstrap.
Style comments so there is more whitespace
Remove ipsum riker content
Add feedback control to spell pages
If the user has reveiwed the spell, change "Write a Review" to "Edit Your Review"
Rating stars need more contrast
Feedback control, don't display "Please enter a comment" unless they have submitted feedback.
Users should be able to rate a spell without writing a review.
If the user is not logged in, replace the "Write a Review" button with a "Log in to review this spell"

Backlog
=======================================
Welcome message and FAQ
Check all messages for log in, log out, confirm email, register, etc., to make sure the messages make sense and are polite.
Make sure the authenticated and anonymous user experiences are correct.
Log errors to database
Feedback control for site recommendations for alpha and beta testers. 
Each page should remember what sub tab it's on when the page is refreshed.
What is the appropriate response for a PUT for both success and failure? (updateCharacterComplete)
Should I be using http interceptors to handle api 404s? 
Is there a way to hide api 404s in the console? Angular is logging them before the responseError interceptor is fired. It doesn't appear to be happening in requestError, responseError, or response.
Use flexbox instead of floats for layout (does this matter if I use Bootstrap?)

Release 1
=======================================
= Included: 
=   Spell ratings, comments, and shenanigans
=======================================

What is this site anyway? 
-------------------------
A place for DMs and players to find tools so they can run and play the game more easily.

Major sections:
Spells with ratings and shenanigans
Skills with ratings and shenanigans
Class guides with ratings and shenanigans

Many of these are tools to help users and DMs make informed decisions

Later it could be a character sheet repository
Much later it could be a virtual asynchronous "table"
