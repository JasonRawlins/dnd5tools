Amazon-type review experience. You review it, rate it, and add a comment. Then there is a "was this helpful" option for each review. 
Style all content. Possibly leverage Bootstrap.
Feedback control for site recommendations for alpha and beta testers. 
Comment on a review. Comments aren't displayed prominently though.
Log errors to database
Most helpful reviews at top
Each page should remember what sub tab it's on when the page is refreshed.
What is the appropriate response for a PUT for both success and failure? (updateCharacterComplete)
Should I be using http interceptors to handle api 404s? 
Is there a way to hide api 404s in the console? Angular is logging them before the responseError interceptor is fired. It doesn't appear to be happening in requestError, responseError, or response.
Use flexbox instead of floats for layout (does this matter if I use Bootstrap?)

What is this site anyway? 
-------------------------
A place for DMs and players to find tools so they can run and play the game more easily.

Major sections:
Spells with ratings and shenanigans
Skills with ratings and shenanigans
Class guides with ratings and shenanigans

Many of these are tools to help users and DMs make informed decisions

Later it could be a character sheet repository
Much later it could be a virtual asynchronous "table"
